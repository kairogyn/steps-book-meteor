// The meteorite resolver.
//
// Given a list of dependencies (consisting of basePackages each of which is a range of package versions
// for a single package), resolve to a concrete list of packages (each of which is a fixed version).
//
// If called without force, will fail if the same package is included with different source types.
// Otherwise, uses the heuristic: path > git > atmos, with a first come first served approach within
// subtype.
//
// PROPOSED ALGORITHM:
//
// The resolver uses a backtracking search algorithm.
//
// We maintain a set of unresolved package/version ranges, and a list of resolved packages of a fixed
// version. In each step of the algorithm, we pull one unresolved package off the list, and:
//   1. if we are out of unresolved packages, we call the success callback.
//   2. else, enumerate all versions that we can try, trying the first.
//   3. if that fails, it'll call a failure callback, which tries the next.
//   4. if there is no next, call the parent failure callback.
//
// TODO -- fixup the above description, it sucks.
